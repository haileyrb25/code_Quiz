# Hailey Bates Code Quiz
Do you remember watching your favorite show as a kid? Was it a cartoon, a comedy, or maybe even a whole network? Well back in the 90's , one show in particular sparked a huge craze for comedy. Friends was a show released in 1994 about 6 friends who lived in New York City. However, it did much more than portray their lives as mostly single people living in a busy city. This show made their fans feel like part of their friend group! This show is still watched by millions today.


Want to see if you know a little bit about the show? Or if you're a true fan, why not try out this quiz to see if you remember some fun facts.
